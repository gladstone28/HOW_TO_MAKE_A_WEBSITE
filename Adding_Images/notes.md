SITE STRUCTURE

Adding Images
--------------

To add images to a webpage, use the HTML image element:

<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/bikes1.jpg"/>
Just like websites have URLs, images on the web also have URLs. Image URLs typically end with the .jpg or .png file extension. The src attribute sets the source for an image element.

Image elements are self-closing, which means they do not need a closing tag.

Letâ€™s use an image element to add a photograph to our webpage.
