SITE STRUCTURE
==================

What are HTML and CSS?
--------------------------


All websites use HTML and CSS. After learning both of these languages, you will be ready to build your own website!

1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to give websites structure with text, links, images, and other fundamental elements.

2. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to change the appearance of HTML elements.


Instructions
===============

An individual page of a website is referred to as a webpage. Notice the webpage in the web browser. During this lesson, we will explore the HTML elements used to build it. Click Next to learn about the anatomy of an HTML element.

SITE STRUCTURE
Create an Unordered List
Impressive! With just five page elements, you’ve already created an interesting website!

Another essential HTML element is the unordered list. Items in an unordered list are referred to as list items. Each item is bulleted, not numbered. For example:

A list item
A second list item
A third list item
The HTML code for the list above:

<ul>
  <li>A list item</li>
  <li>A second list item</li>
  <li>A third list item</li>
</ul> 



About unordered lists:

ul tags create the unordered list.


li tags contain each list item.

Unordered list elements can be used to organize content on a webpage in a number of ways. Below we will use one to organize our website’s navigation menu, sometimes called a navbar.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Below the navbar h2, create an unordered list element. The list items will be different pages a site user can visit:

<ul>
  <li>sign up</li>
  <li>search bikes</li>
  <li>reserve a bike</li>
  <li>about us</li>
</ul>
After you insert all the list items, don’t forget to close the unordered list with a closing </ul> tag.

Run your code to view the results in the web browser.


Next, use an anchor element to link the word “list” to the URL cities.html.

Here is a <a href="cities.html">list</a> of cities where you can find us. 
Note: cities.html is within the Ollie site folder, so we do not need to specify a full URL
